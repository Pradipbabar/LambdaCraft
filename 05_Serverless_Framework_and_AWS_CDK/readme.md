# 5. Serverless Framework and AWS CDK

Welcome to the fifth section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! In this section, we'll introduce you to two powerful tools: the Serverless Framework for deploying and managing Lambda functions and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for infrastructure as code.

## Introduction to Serverless Framework

The Serverless Framework simplifies the deployment and management of serverless applications. In this section, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how to use the Serverless Framework to deploy and manage Lambda functions efficiently. Refer to the `serverless_framework_intro.md` file for a detailed introduction.

## Basics of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

AWS CDK is a powerful tool for defining cloud infrastructure as code. Learn the basics of AWS CDK to provision AWS resources using familiar programming languages. Explore the `aws_cdk_basics.md` file to grasp the foundational concepts of AWS CDK and its benefits in managing infrastructure.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on learning about the Serverless Framework and AWS CDK! In the upcoming sections, we'll dive into advanced Lambda concepts, handling different event sources, and connecting Lambda with other AWS services.

Continue your Pythonic Serverless Odyssey with LambdaCraft! Each step brings you closer to mastering serverless development with Python on AWS. ðŸš€
