# Basics of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a powerful tool that allows developers to define cloud infrastructure as code (IaC) using familiar programming languages. In this guide, we will explore the basics of AWS CDK, enabling you to provision AWS resources efficiently. Refer to the "aws_cdk_basics.md" file for a detailed understanding.

## What is AWS CDK?

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. Unlike traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools that use domain-specific languages, AWS CDK leverages familiar programming languages such as Python, TypeScript, Java, and others.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Constructs:**
   - The fundamental building blocks in AWS CDK are constructs, which represent AWS resources or groups of resources.
   - Constructs are defined in your chosen programming language and are used to model infrastructure components.

2. **Staging:**
   - AWS CDK allows you to stage your infrastructure for different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
   - This helps in managing configurations and deploying changes consistently across environments.

3. **Language Support:**
   - AWS CDK supports multiple programming languages, allowing developers to use the language they are most comfortable with.
   - Languages include Python, TypeScript, Java, C#, and more.

4. **High-Level Abstractions:**
   - AWS CDK provides high-level abstractions for commonly used AWS resources, simplifying the process of defining complex infrastructure.

## Getting Started with AWS CDK

To get started with AWS CDK:

1. **Installation:**
   - Install the AWS CDK CLI globally using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g aws-cdk
     ```

2. **Initialize a CDK Project:**
   - Create a new CDK project using the `cdk init` command:
     ```bash
     cdk init app --language=python
     ```

3. **Define Constructs:**
   - Write constructs in your chosen programming language to define AWS resources and their relationships.

4. **Deploy the Infrastructure:**
   - Use the `cdk deploy` command to deploy the defined infrastructure to your AWS account.

5. **Manage and Update:**
   - Make changes to your code and redeploy using `cdk deploy` to update the deployed infrastructure.

## Example CDK Code (Python)

Here's a simple example of a Python CDK code that creates an Amazon S3 bucket:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_s3 as s3,
    core
)

class MyS3BucketStack(core.Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # Create an S3 bucket
        s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")

app = core.App()
MyS3BucketStack(app, "MyS3BucketStack")
app.synth()
