# 2. Setting Up AWS Lambda with Python

Welcome to the second section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! In this segment, we'll guide you through the process of setting up AWS Lambda with Python. Get ready to configure AWS Lambda basics, deploy your first function, and explore advanced deployment with AWS SAM.

## Configure AWS Lambda Basics

Before diving into deployment, let's understand the fundamental configurations:

- **Regions:** AWS Lambda operates in specific regions worldwide. Familiarize yourself with regions to optimize your application's performance and compliance.

- **IAM Roles:** Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles define the permissions your Lambda function needs. Learn to configure roles for secure and fine-grained access.

## Deploy Your First Lambda Function

Explore the exhilarating experience of deploying your inaugural Lambda function. We'll cover two methods:

### AWS Management Console Deployment:

Follow the steps in `deploy_with_aws_console.py` to deploy a Lambda function using the AWS Management Console. Gain insights into the user-friendly console interface and the simplicity of function deployment.

### AWS CLI Deployment:

For a more hands-on approach, `deploy_with_aws_cli.sh` demonstrates deploying a Lambda function using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). This approach allows for automation and scripting.

## Explore AWS SAM for Advanced Deployments

As you progress in your serverless journey, familiarize yourself with the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). SAM extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way to define serverless applications.

Discover advanced deployment techniques and streamline your development workflow using `explore_aws_sam.md`. SAM enables you to define serverless applications, making deployment and management more efficient.

### Next Steps
