# 4. Lambda Runtimes and Layers

Welcome to the fourth section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! This section is dedicated to understanding Lambda runtimes and leveraging Lambda Layers for efficient code sharing.

## Explore Different Lambda Runtimes

Lambda supports various programming languages through runtimes. Delve into the possibilities by exploring different Lambda runtimes. The `explore_runtimes.md` file introduces you to the available options and their use cases.

## Create Custom Runtimes

Unleash the power of custom runtimes! Learn how to create a runtime tailored to your specific requirements. The `create_custom_runtime.md` file guides you through the process, empowering you to craft a runtime environment that suits your application's needs.

## Leverage Lambda Layers

Lambda Layers enable efficient code sharing and management. Explore the benefits and learn how to leverage Lambda Layers for enhanced modularity. The `lambda_layers.md` file provides insights into creating and using Layers effectively.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on gaining insights into Lambda runtimes and Layers! As you progress through the repository, you'll delve deeper into the Serverless Framework, AWS CDK, and advanced Lambda concepts.

Continue your Pythonic Serverless Odyssey with LambdaCraft! The journey is filled with opportunities to optimize, innovate, and build powerful serverless applications. ðŸš€
