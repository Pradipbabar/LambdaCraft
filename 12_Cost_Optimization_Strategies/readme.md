# 12. Cost Optimization Strategies

Welcome to the twelfth section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! In this section, we'll focus on cost optimization strategies for Lambda functions. Grasp Lambda pricing models, learn how to optimize costs, and implement strategies to optimize runtime and memory usage.

## Lambda Pricing Optimization

Understand Lambda pricing models to make informed decisions about optimizing costs. Explore the `lambda_pricing_optimization.md` file to gain insights into how pricing is calculated and discover strategies to minimize expenses.

## Optimize Runtime and Memory

Implement strategies to optimize runtime and memory usage for Lambda functions. The `optimize_runtime_and_memory.md` file provides practical guidance on configuring runtime settings and memory allocation to achieve cost-effective performance.

## Resource Cleanup and Management

Learn best practices for cleaning up and managing resources to avoid unnecessary costs. Explore the `resource_cleanup_and_management.md` file to understand how to handle unused resources, manage deployments, and optimize resource usage.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on mastering cost optimization strategies for Lambda functions! As you progress through the repository, you'll explore real-world examples, community contributions, and additional resources.
