# 7. Event Sources and Triggers

Welcome to the seventh section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! In this section, we'll focus on event sources and triggers, demonstrating how to understand and implement triggers using S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and CloudWatch Events.

## Triggers Using S3

Learn how to configure Lambda functions to respond to changes in an S3 bucket. Explore the `s3_triggers.md` file to understand the configuration options and implement S3 triggers effectively.

## Triggers Using DynamoDB

Discover how to set up Lambda triggers based on changes to a DynamoDB table. The `dynamodb_triggers.md` file provides insights into configuring DynamoDB triggers and handling events from your database.

## API Gateway Integration

Understand the integration of Lambda functions with API Gateway for building scalable and secure APIs. Dive into the `api_gateway_integration.md` file to explore the configuration and deployment of Lambda-backed APIs.

## CloudWatch Events as Triggers

Explore how to use CloudWatch Events to trigger Lambda functions based on scheduled events or custom conditions. The `cloudwatch_events.md` file guides you through setting up event rules and integrating them with your functions.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on mastering event sources and triggers! As you progress through the repository, you'll delve into connecting Lambda with additional AWS services, optimizing performance, and implementing continuous integration and deployment.
