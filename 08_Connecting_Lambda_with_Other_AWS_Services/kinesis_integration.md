# Integrating AWS Lambda with Kinesis Data Streams for Real-Time Data Processing

Explore the seamless integration of AWS Lambda functions with Kinesis Data Streams for efficient and real-time data processing. This guide, outlined in the "kinesis_integration.md" file, provides insights into configuring Lambda to process and analyze streaming data effectively, enabling you to build scalable and responsive serverless applications.

## Why Kinesis Data Streams Integration?

Integrating Lambda functions with Kinesis Data Streams allows you to ingest, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at scale. Kinesis provides a reliable and scalable platform for collecting and transmitting data, while Lambda enables serverless, event-driven processing, making it ideal for scenarios such as log processing, analytics, and IoT data processing.

## Setting Up Kinesis Integration with Lambda:

1. **Create a Kinesis Data Stream:**
   - In the AWS Kinesis console, create a new Kinesis Data Stream that will serve as the source for your streaming data.

2. **Configure Kinesis Data Stream for Lambda Trigger:**
   - In the AWS Lambda console, configure a new trigger for your Lambda function, using the Kinesis Data Stream as the event source.
   - Specify the batch size and starting position for processing records.

3. **Lambda Function Code for Kinesis:**
   - Write your Lambda function code to process records from the Kinesis Data Stream. Below is a simple Python example:

```python
import base64
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        # Decode and process the base64-encoded data from the Kinesis record
        kinesis_data = base64.b64decode(record['kinesis']['data']).decode('utf-8')
        print(f"Received Kinesis record: {json.loads(kinesis_data)}")
        
        # Add your custom processing logic here
