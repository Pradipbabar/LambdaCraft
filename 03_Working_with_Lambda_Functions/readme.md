# 3. Working with Lambda Functions

Welcome to the third section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! In this section, we'll delve into the intricacies of working with AWS Lambda functions. Gain a deep understanding of a Lambda function's anatomy, configure environment variables, and learn how to handle multiple events.

## Anatomy of a Lambda Function

Explore the core structure and components that make up a Lambda function. The `lambda_anatomy.py` file will guide you through the different sections, helping you comprehend how code, triggers, and configurations come together.

## Configure Environment Variables

Effectively utilize environment variables to store configuration settings for your Lambda functions. Understanding how to manage sensitive information, such as API keys, within your function is crucial. The `configure_environment_variables.md` file provides insights into setting up and managing environment variables securely.

## Handle Multiple Events

Lambda functions are often designed to respond to various events. Learn how to configure your functions to handle multiple types of events efficiently. The `handle_multiple_events.py` file showcases examples of handling diverse events, from S3 uploads to API Gateway requests.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on advancing your understanding of working with Lambda functions! As you continue through the repository, you'll explore advanced Lambda concepts, event triggers, and the integration of Lambda with other AWS services.
