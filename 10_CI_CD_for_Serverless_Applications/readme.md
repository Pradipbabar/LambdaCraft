# 10. CI/CD for Serverless Applications

Welcome to the tenth section of the **LambdaCraft: Pythonic Serverless Odyssey** repository! In this section, we'll focus on setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for your serverless applications. Learn how to automate deployment pipelines, develop testing strategies for Lambda functions, and implement infrastructure as code with CI/CD.

## Automated Deployment Pipelines

Explore the setup of automated deployment pipelines to streamline the release process. The `automated_deployment_pipelines.md` file provides insights into configuring CI/CD tools to deploy your Lambda functions seamlessly.

## Testing Strategies for Lambda Functions

Develop effective testing strategies to ensure the reliability and functionality of your Lambda functions. The `testing_strategies.md` file guides you through unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing for serverless applications.

## Infrastructure as Code with CI/CD

Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) practices for Lambda functions within a CI/CD environment. Learn how to version control your infrastructure and automate deployments with the AWS CDK. The `infrastructure_as_code_with_cicd.md` file provides practical examples and best practices.

### Next Steps

Congratulations on setting up CI/CD for your serverless applications! As you progress through the repository, you'll dive into security best practices, real-world examples, and community contributions.

Continue your Pythonic Serverless Odyssey with LambdaCraft! Each section adds valuable skills to your serverless development toolkit. ðŸš€
